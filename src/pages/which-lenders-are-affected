            Which Lenders Are Affected by Car Finance Mis-Selling?
          </h1>

          <p className="mt-4 text-lg">
            Many people assume car finance mis-selling only affects certain
            lenders. In reality, the focus is not on specific names, but on how
            finance agreements were sold.

          <Section title="Why lender names are not the starting point">
            <p>
              Mis-selling concerns arise from sales practices, incentives and
              disclosure. Two customers with the same lender can have very
              different experiences depending on how their agreement was
              arranged.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Dealership-based lending models">
            <p>
              Many UK car finance lenders distribute their products through
              dealerships. This means the dealer plays a central role in
              presenting the finance, explaining terms, and setting expectations.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="How lenders can still be responsible">
            <p>
              Although the dealer sells the finance, the lender provides the
              credit and sets the framework within which the sale takes place.
              This can include commission structures and permitted interest rate
              ranges.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Are some lenders more commonly discussed?">
            <p>
              Public discussion often focuses on lenders that used certain
              commission models or had high volumes of dealership-distributed
              finance. This does not mean other lenders are excluded.
            </p>
          </Section>

          <Section title="Why eligibility is lender-neutral">
            <p>
              Eligibility depends on disclosure, transparency and incentives —
              not on the lender’s brand. This is why complaints are assessed on a
              case-by-case basis.

          <Section title="What to do if you are unsure">
            <p>
              If you do not know who your lender was, this does not prevent
              further review. Lenders usually hold records of agreements, even
              where paperwork is missing.
