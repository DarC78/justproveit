        <h1>What Is Car Finance Mis-Selling?</h1>

        <p>
          Car finance mis-selling happens when a finance agreement is sold without
          full transparency, fairness or informed consent.
        </p>

        <h2>Common examples</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hidden or undisclosed commission</li>
          <li>Inflated interest rates</li>
          <li>Unclear or bundled add-ons</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Not every agreement is mis-sold. Each case depends on how the agreement
          was explained and agreed.
