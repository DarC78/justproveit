            Car finance mis-selling is not always limited to interest rates and
            commission. Optional add-ons and extras sold alongside finance
            agreements can also raise concerns where disclosure or consent was
            unclear.

            <p>
              Add-ons are additional products sold at the point of purchase,
              often alongside a car finance agreement. While they can offer
              genuine value in some cases, concerns arise when they are sold
              without proper explanation.

            <p>
              When add-ons are financed rather than paid upfront, customers may
              pay interest on those products for the full term of the agreement.
              This can significantly increase the overall cost.

          <Section title="Do add-ons guarantee mis-selling?">
            <p>
              No. The presence of add-ons does not automatically mean
              mis-selling occurred. The key issue is how they were explained,
              priced, and agreed.

          <Section title="What to do if add-ons were unclear">
            <p>
              If you believe add-ons were included without proper explanation,
              they may form part of a wider review of how your agreement was
              sold.
